# Inaugural project

#We have tried to solve the consumer maximization problem by relying on existing code from the lectures and the exercise sets.

#For question 1 we have constructed a function that solves the maximization problem. The code is inspired by the third lecture on how to #optimize, print and plot.

#From problem set 1 we have inspiration to plot the the optimal labour supply as a function of wage as well as the optimal consumption as a #function of w.

#In question 3 we calculate the total tax revenue given the optimal values of labour supply, consumption and uniformly distributed wage #draws.

#Finally we recalculate the total tax revenue given a new value of epsilon.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject copy.ipynb](inauguralproject copy.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
