# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **IS-LM-PC Model** which is a basic macroeconomic model that has replaced the AS-AD model in some newer macroeconomic textbooks. It describes the medium run by combining the IS-LM model with the Phillips curve, thus creating a relation between inflation, unemployment, the output gap, and interest rate policy. 
The goal of the project is to optimize the interest rate chosen by the central bank, whose utility function reflect that they take bouth the inflation and unemployment into account.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [ISLMPC.ipynb](ISLM.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
